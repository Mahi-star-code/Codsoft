Key Requirements:
1. Short and Sweet: Minimize the number of steps and fields to reduce user friction.
2. Useful: Collect only essential information for app functionality.
3. Error-Free: Implement robust validation and error handling to prevent user frustration.
4. Secure: Ensure the protection of user personal information through secure protocols and practices.
